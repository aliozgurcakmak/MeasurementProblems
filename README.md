**Topics Covered:**
- **Measurement Problems**: Challenges in accurately assessing systems, behaviors, or processes.
- **Data Bias**: How overrepresented groups or behaviors can skew results.
- **Behavioral Deviations**: The impact of social contexts or norms on human behavior.
- **Improper Metrics**: The importance of selecting relevant metrics for meaningful results.
- **Social Proof**: Understanding how individuals use others' behaviors to guide their own actions.
- **Wisdom of Crowds**: The idea that collective decisions are often more accurate than individual ones.

### 2. Rating Products (RatingProducts.py)
**Description:**
This script explores various methods for calculating product ratings, including average ratings, time-based weighted averages, and user-based weighted averages. It also demonstrates how to combine these methods into a final weighted rating.

**Topics Covered:**
- **Average Rating**: Calculating the mean rating of products.
- **Time-Based Weighted Average**: Adjusting ratings based on the recency of reviews.
- **User-Based Weighted Average**: Weighting ratings based on user engagement.
- **Weighted Rating**: Combining time-based and user-based weights for a final score.

### 3. Sorting Products (SortingProducts.py)
**Description:**
This script demonstrates methods for sorting and ranking products based on ratings, comment counts, and purchase counts. It includes techniques for calculating weighted sorting scores and Bayesian average ratings.

**Topics Covered:**
- **Sorting by Rating**: Ordering products by their rating.
- **Sorting by Comment or Purchase Count**: Prioritizing products with higher engagement.
- **Weighted Sorting Score**: Combining multiple metrics to rank products.
- **Bayesian Average Rating**: Using Bayesian statistics to adjust ratings based on the number of votes.
- **Hybrid Sorting**: Combining different sorting metrics for a comprehensive ranking.

### 4. Sorting Reviews (SortingReviews.py)
**Description:**
This script focuses on sorting and ranking user reviews based on various scoring methods. It includes the calculation of up-down diff scores, average ratings, and Wilson lower bound scores to rank reviews effectively.

**Topics Covered:**
- **Up-Down Diff Score**: Calculating the difference between upvotes and downvotes.
- **Average Rating**: Computing the average score based on upvotes and downvotes.
- **Wilson Lower Bound**: Estimating the lower bound of a confidence interval for a proportion.
- **Case Study**: Applying these metrics to a dataset of reviews to rank them effectively.

### 5. IMDB Scoring and Sorting Application (IMDB_Scoring_Sorting_Application.py)
**Description:**
This script focuses on scoring and sorting movies based on IMDB data. It includes methods for calculating weighted ratings and Bayesian average ratings to rank movies effectively.

**Topics Covered:**
- **Sorting by Vote Average**: Ranking movies by their average votes.
- **IMDB Weighted Rating**: Calculating weighted ratings using IMDB's formula.
- **BAR Score**: Applying Bayesian Average Rating to sort movies effectively.

### 6. Case Study: Amazon Product Reviews (CaseStudy1.py)
**Description:**
This case study focuses on analyzing Amazon product reviews. The goal is to calculate the average rating of products based on user reviews and adjust these ratings by considering the recency of the reviews. The study also explores methods to rank reviews based on helpfulness and statistical reliability.

**Data Used:**
- Amazon product reviews, including variables such as reviewer ID, product ID, review text, rating, review time, and helpful votes.

**Topics Covered:**
- **Average Rating Calculation**: Computing average product ratings.
- **Time-Weighted Average**: Adjusting ratings based on the age of reviews.
- **Review Scoring**: Using metrics like helpful votes to rank reviews.
- **Wilson Lower Bound**: Applying statistical techniques to ensure robust review rankings.

### 7. AB Testing (abTesting.py)
**Description:**
This script provides a comprehensive overview of A/B testing techniques. It covers sampling methods, descriptive statistics, confidence intervals, correlation analysis, and various statistical tests for comparing groups.

**Topics Covered:**
- **Sampling**: Techniques for creating samples from populations.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing and describing data distributions.
- **Confidence Intervals**: Calculating intervals to estimate population parameters.
- **Correlation**: Measuring relationships between variables.
- **AB Testing**: Comparing groups using statistical tests.
- **Two-Sample Proportion Test**: Comparing proportions between two groups.
- **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)**: Comparing means across multiple groups.

### 8. Case Study: AB Testing (CaseStudy2.py)
**Description:**
This case study involves an A/B test comparing two bidding methods (maximum bidding and average bidding) to determine which one yields better conversion rates. The study involves formulating hypotheses, checking assumptions, and applying statistical tests to draw conclusions.

**Data Used:**
- Web traffic and conversion data for two groups subjected to different bidding methods.

**Topics Covered:**
- **AB Testing**: Comparing two bidding methods using statistical tests.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Formulating and testing hypotheses using t-tests and non-parametric tests.
- **Assumption Checks**: Validating assumptions of normality and variance homogeneity.
- **Result Interpretation**: Drawing conclusions from p-values and test statistics.
